      <h2>Intro and The World Wide Web</h2>The web enables <em>clients</em> (computers and browsers) to exchange information (text, images, audio, etc.) via the <em>internet</em> with <em>servers</em> (basically computers designed to store and send data).<br><br> These components communicate with each other through a protocol called <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/">(HTTP)</a> and present information in <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">(HTML)</a>,which is the language browsers use to interpret webpages.

      <h2>The Basics of HTML</h2> When coding in HTML or any other language, we are in essence writing instructions for a computer to perform an action. The inability <em>(so far!)</em> of computers to successfully deduct what we want from context, requires us to be precise, otherwise the computer will not understand, which in turn leads to unnecessary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJkBZ0sQ9mI">frustration</a>. Hence the need for specifc instructions.

      <h2>Components of HTML</h2>HTML intructions include:<br><br><em><b>(1) Elements</b></em>- what we use to tell the computer how to display a page. Usually composed of <em>content</em>, <em>tags</em> and in some cases <em>attributes</em>.<br><br><em><b>(2) Content</b></em>- that which is displayed (text, images, etc.)<br><br> <em><b>(3) Tags</b></em>- indicates how the content is displayed and in most cases requires an opening and closing tag. Take as an example the tag: <em>"&lt;b&gt;content&lt;/b&gt;"</em> which makes the word <b>"content" bold</b>. Another common tag is: <em>&lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;</em>, which renders the text in <em>italics</em>.<br><br> <em><b>(4) Attributes</b></em>- some tags allow for additional "instructions", which follow the format <em>name="value"</em>. For example the anchor tag: <em>"&lt;a href="URL"&g;content&lt;/a&gt;"</em>, tells the browser to create a link (from the word "content") to a specific URL. <b>(Note: values seems to be always within "").</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some elements are considered <em>block elements</em>, which are elements that create "blocks" or sections in the code or the webpage. In contrast, <em>inline elments</em> do not create separate sections.<br><br>Examples of block elments include:  <em>&lt;p&gt;content&lt;/p&gt;</em>, and <em>&lt;div&gt;content&lt;/div&gt;</em>, which indicate the creation of a new paragraph when writing text on a webpage and the definition of a separate "box" section or container in an HTML document respectively.<br><br>Examples of inline elements include: <em>&lt;br&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;span&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;</em>. The former indicates a line break in the text and also happens to be a <em>void tag</em> (i.e. it doesn't need a closing).The latter creates an <em>inline</em> container element (as opposed to <em>&lt;div&gt;content&lt;/div&gt;</em>).
